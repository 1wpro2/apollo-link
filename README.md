Apollo Link is a standard interface for modifying the control flow of GraphQL requests, and fetching GraphQL results, designed to provide a simple GraphQL client that is capable of extensions. The Apollo Link interface is designed to make Links composable and easy to share, each with a single purpose. While core Apollo Link functionality is built into [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), this repository contains Links for additional functionality. Refer to the [Apollo Client docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for more details around these Links.

## Documentation

All Apollo Client documentation, including Apollo Link usage articles and helpful recipes, lives on [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
